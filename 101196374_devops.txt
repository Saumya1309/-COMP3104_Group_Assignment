This course is designed to better prepare professionals entering the IT field.
Specifically, a field where servers, web apps and infrastructure will be core to
business needs. COMP 3104 will provide a hands-on experience through the
implementation of tried, tested and true DevOps technologies.
We will also examine ways in which companies have either lost or saved fortunes
with DevOps strategies. Learning about Amazon Web Services, Ansible, Docker and
Travis CI.Under a DevOps model, development and operations teams are no longer “siloed.” Sometimes, these two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.

In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.
These teams use practices to automate processes that historically have been manual and slow. They use a technology stack and tooling which help them operate and evolve applications quickly and reliably. These tools also help engineers independently accomplish tasks (for example, deploying code or provisioning infrastructure) that normally would have required help from other teams, and this further increases a team’s velocity
